          for ages! Pizza hungry but don't feel like going for a pizza
          - some pizza time! I finally made you guys my husband's go-to
          pizza and you'll definitely appreciate the whole grain
          benefits and how light you'll feel after. Enjoy a pizza
          half the time, one you can prepare in minutes and a way to
          enjoy pizza in a much healthier way!

          <h2>Method</h2>
          <p>
            The measured oat and ingredients recipe is 15-20 minutes.
            Prepare still will take a few minutes as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pre-heat oven to 200 degrees C.  Lay a piece of baking paper on
            a baking tray, or a pizza stone.  They could strengthen the dough
            and help with coverage in baking.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a medium bowl, combine the dry ingredients first then add the wet
            ingredients and mix until a dough forms.  Add the dry
            ingredients to half a cup at a time, adding the oat dough
            dough bit by bit.  If you don't have a baking dish
            for 10 inches of diameter, use a few baking sheets
            and use two.  Bake for 15-20 minutes, and top off with
            your desired toppings.  I opted for a homemade tomato sauce,
            and mozzarella cheese, with vegetable, but you can
            customize your pizza to your desire, and enjoy!

                Home made great! I love it, but if you don't have a springform
                pan or a pizza pan - just a cookie pan, you can adjust it a
                little bit, definitely. I would make it for my extended family
                for sure!

                It's plus or minus, I don't have a scale, will keep it a
                couple of tablespoons, or less, just so it won't burn.
                Thank you for the recipe!
